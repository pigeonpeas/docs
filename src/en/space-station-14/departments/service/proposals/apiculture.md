## Overview

Apiculture, also known as Beekeeping, would add Apiaries into hydroponics, allowing botanists to take care of bees along with their usual job. This adds more variety to a botanist's job, allowing them to use their plants in a new way, generating resources like honey for the entire station. They would also be able to mutate bees, allowing them to generate more chemicals for the station, allowing for an alternate source of chemicals in the case that chemistry can no longer produce them.

## Background

In /TG/station, Apiculture is available to help flesh out hydroponics, giving botanists more to do than just grow plants. Botany is already vital for other service jobs, such as bartender, or chef, but this would make them even more so, as some recipes for food/drink would require honey to make. Honey would also be used in the creation of a few medicines, making botany interact with chemistry a bit more. Bees would also give botanists a bit of offensive capabilities, being able to mutate their bees to inject deadly chemicals. Mutating bees is a tricky task, however, as the queen dying would mean the production of bees, and the spread of mutation would come to a complete stop.

## The rest?

Is entirely up to you.
