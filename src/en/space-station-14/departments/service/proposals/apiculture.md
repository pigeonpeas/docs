## Overview

Apiculture would add Apiaries into hydroponics, allowing botanists to take care of bees along with their usual job. At roundstart, a queen bee will have to be placed inside of a hive to start producing bees. These bees would exit the nest, and seek out plants to get nectar, and sustain their hive. After bees get nectar and bring it back to the hive, they will then produce honey. Without any plants to harvest nectar from, a hive will eventually die out, leading to the botanists having to purchase a new queen to start a new hive.

## Background

In /TG/station, Apiculture is available to help flesh out hydroponics, giving botanists more to do than just grow plants. Botany is already vital for other service jobs, such as bartender, or chef, but this would make them even more so, as some recipes for food/drink would require honey to make. Honey would also be used in the creation of a few medicines, making botany interact with chemistry a bit more. Bees would also give botanists a bit of offensive capabilities, being able to mutate their bees to inject deadly chemicals. Mutating bees is a tricky task, however, as the queen dying would mean the production of bees, and the spread of mutation would come to a complete stop.

## The rest?

Is entirely up to you.
